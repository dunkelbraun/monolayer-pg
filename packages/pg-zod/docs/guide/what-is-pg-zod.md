# What is pg-zod?

[pg-zod](https://dunkelbraun.github.io/monolayer-pg) is a package that generates comprehensive [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas from tables declared with [monolayer-pg](https://dunkelbraun.github.io/monolayer-pg).

Use the generated Zod schemas to validate data before inserting or updating data to the database. You can extend them also to validate business logic.

The Zod schemas generated by `pg-zod` will take into account:

- The data type of the column.
- The column nullability and its default value.
- Whether the column is a primary key or generated.
- Specific column data type validations that match validations at database level. For example, the range of an `integer` column is: -2147483648 to +2147483647.
